# LoR deck name editor
I made this project to practice Vue.js. Last patch it was updated is 1.12. I'm not going to update it in the future.
# How I looked up sprites and their names/numbers in LoR game files
I used Asset Studio (https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) to load and export LoR game assets.
Sprite assets are located at "..\Riot Games\LoR\live\PatcherData\PatchableFiles\AssetBundles\assets\assetlibrary\atlas\generated" folder.
I cropped textures and looked at MonoBehavior files to correlate sprites with their names/numbers.

Update: Tested the sprites in the app, and all of them changed, so i fixed the way they are called here, in the web ^^
